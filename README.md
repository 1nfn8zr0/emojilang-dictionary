Collaborative gSheet exists, but is invite only. This repo is a summary of that work.

Digigon's 5 Principles (02018)
1) The golden rule of world order: context to statement, general to specific, topic to comment, actor to action. Deviating from this order will cause confusion, and under the difficult constraints we have, we're striving for simplicity.
2) Choose your emoji wisely. There are only so many emoji, and if you want to communicate clearly you should ensure that the characters you pick are the best choices for the meanings you want. If you can't find a good pick in one character, use multiple or build off of what we already have. In the interest of saving the more metaphorically powerful characters for later, use the less evocative or niche characters whenever appropriate.
3) Verify that an emoji means what you think it does. You'll find through resources such as Emojipedia that the meanings of a wide range of characters are different from what one might assume. Did you know that the spiral in the symbols section is a cyclone marker? Be familiar with as many emoji as possible, if not all of them, to make good decisions on which to use and how to use them.
4) Discuss how things should work. If no one talks about how the language works, we can't build a consensus about it or fix things that are broken.
5) Play with what we've built. Testing the limits of phrasing and creating works such as poetry will prove the language beyond its ability to make basic statements.

Guidelines & Visionary principles for development:
1. emoji came from Japan, and emojilang originated with Japanese speakers. Thus we strive to maintain that grammar as a guideline for word order. All the descriptors come first, but modify the latter. (Head final)
2. "The golden rule of world order: context to statement, general to specific, topic to comment, actor to action. "
3. Meaning is in the context and interpretation. Many characters have cultural meaning that may differ geographically (hand signals - a few of them are impolite only in certain regions of the world), as well as common usage dictated by culture. The main meanings of a character are from: the text of the name (within : brackets:, you can talk about them using ;semicolons;), the literal appearance of the emoji, the implied visual meaning, a figurative meaning (often based upon the function/use or characteristics of the emoji)
4. Characters used for grammar should try to be respected such that it becomes universal. Exceptions to their grammatical use should be clear by exaggeration from multiple repeats in a row, or otherwise made clear in context.
5. A language is a living thing. It is not a language if no one is using it to communicate. If you want it to be a thing, try incorporating it into your daily communications or encouraging others to learn and use it. If it is impossible to learn or communicate to others, it will not spread and grow and evolve.
6. There is no right or wrong, there is only consensus. Consider respecting rules until you know why they were made, and then intentional evolution of breaking them will be more constructive rather than chaotic. You don't have to be perfect, just understood.
7. Linguistics is a good source for ideas, but overly complicated formalisms may increase the complexity needlessly.
8. Since emoji are time-consuming to write on most platforms, strive for efficiency and simplicity and clarity. Sometimes this will involve a time in the communication spent defining what you want to say using a character, and then afterwards that single character can be used as an implied abbreviation for that set of concepts that were explicitly bounded.
9. Have fun with it. Don't start fights or drama or otherwise make the community toxic. We're inventing a new kind of language here, so a spirit of play and creativity is of benefit. Millions of people have access to emoji and use them in their communications. They will all have their own interpretations and habits of how to use them. Those are fine and valid. As speakers of emojilang we are pioneers trying to establish a new way of communicating that transcends traditional alphabets. Use your opportunities to spread knowledge, excitement and engagement for the propagation of a language with vitality and freedom.
**You don't have to be perfect, just understood.**


Existing Trends
Abstract emoji and punctuation type things are more recognizable as grammar
Consistency between styles of emoji and their meaning
Being understood is more important than being correct

Mission / Purpose
To make something learnable, universal, but allow for specificity enough to resolve ambiguity
To adapt to the intuitive usage of emoji, but have a systematic way for expressing more complex thought

Values & Visions	
1nfinitezer0::	"I see something that will be fluid with use "in the wild". Grammar such that is functional, but ways to not force people to swim against the current. So, finding intuitive ways to make the language useful in both formal and informal forms, yet still able to be understood. But informal construction practice SHOULD accord with formal as much as possible, so that if people learn it from others informally, the formal way does not force them to relearn, but allows them to go deeper."
digigon::	"The way I want the language to work is just a lot like Japanese so I end up borrowing from it a lot. It also seems reasonably natural because emoji are Japanese. Overall I'm more concerned with just getting the concept to work than making it as accessible as possible, especially since to make it work I'll have to do a number of tricky things like toki pona did."
